<!-- about the project -->

## Project Summary

Welcome to our final project (but first of many) "WiFinder" - Built for digital nomads who need to find food, warmth and most importantly FREE WIFI!
A 4-team collaborative build using React, Node.js, TailwindCSS and JavaScript. A unique, attractive, API driven web application utilizing Google Maps, GeoApify, FormJS and deployed to Netlify!

#

### Motivation

AS digital nomads, we work to travel. One day my office is a Starbucks and the next an airport lounge. Utilising local network providers is not always possible, so it’s critical I can find free wi-fi.

We wanted users to be able to quickly log into a web app on their phone and hit one button to easily find their nearest free wi-fi hot-spot. They need to be able to see on the map how they can get there, what food and entertainment is nearby and get logged on to some wifi. When planning trips in advance we want to be able to put in any destination details to find out what free WiFi is available in that area to the user.

SO that way, they can always be connected when they need to be.

#

### Challenges

Key Challenges

Building a professional, functional, attractive web app in under 2 weeks
Successfully collaborating, designing & split-building using Github & React
Getting the API’s to work effectively to deliver results and make MVP

Key Successes
Achieving MVP, deploying a decent looking, functional, useful application
Working harmoniously as a solid unit, each bringing their best to the team
Successfully integrating and learning React, Node and Tailwind

#

### Unique Selling Points

**Easy-to-use interface:** The WiFinder app is user-friendly and simple to navigate,
making it easy for digital nomads and remote workers to find and connect to wifi
hotspots quickly and easily.

**Location-based services:** The app uses location-based services to find wifi
hotspots near the user's current location, which means that users can quickly find a
nearby wifi hotspot without having to search manually.

**Comprehensive database:** WiFinder has an extensive database of wifi hotspots,
including coffee shops, libraries, and other public areas, making it easy for users
to find a nearby wifi hotspot wherever they are.

**Reliable connections:** WiFinder only lists reliable and secure wifi hotspots, so
users can trust that they'll be able to connect and work without interruption.

**Free service:** WiFinder is a free service, which makes it an excellent choice for
budget-conscious digital nomads and remote workers.
